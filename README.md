This is heavily based on code transcribed from
Peter Shirley's *"Ray Tracing in One Weekend"*.

I'm using this as an exercise to add/learn more modern c++ (11),
as well as exploring some of the other open source projects.
Compared to raytracer, raytracer2 makes more use of smart
pointers, and I've tried to rename everything to be more readable
along the lines of the Google style guide. raytracer2 still mostly
follows the architecture laid out in the books.

In raytracer2, I'm working through Peter Shirley's second and
third books in the series, *"Raytracing, The Next Week"* and
*"Raytracing the Rest of Your Life"*.

Dependencies:
* boost 1.67.0
* opeinimageio 2.0.0+
