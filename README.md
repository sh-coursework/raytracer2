This is heavily based on code transcribed from
Peter Shirley's *"Ray Tracing in One Weekend"*.

I'm using this as an exercise to add/learn more modern c++ (11),
as well as exploring some of the other open source projects.

In raytracer2, I'm working through Peter Shirley's second book
in the series, *"Raytracing, The Next Week"*.

Dependencies:
* boost 1.67.0
* opeinimageio 2.0.0+
